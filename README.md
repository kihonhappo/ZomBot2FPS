# Overview

I started this project in order to test the waters of Game Development.

This is a simple First Person Shooter game (FPS) created using Unreal Engine 5.2. I originally wanted to create a game that feaatured animations for Rifles, Pistols, and throwing knives. I also wanted to add melee combat as well. I was only able to include rifle and pistol animations.
